        <p class="discs2">The Driver gives you the most distance off the tee.</p>
          <p class="info">Distance Drivers were created to provide players with the maximum distance possible. Some Distance Driver models provide a straight line of flight, while others have the ability to travel to the left or right down the fairway. Some of our distance drivers are designed to cut through the wind, while other discs offer extra glide, providing additional distance for less powerful throwers. All of our Distance Drivers are created to bring maximum range and control in each unique situation.
            <br>  
          Fairway Drivers deliver confidence in both driving and approach situations. For many players, our Fairway Drivers provide nearly the same distance as our Distance Drivers, but with added control and accuracy. Newer players will find these discs easy to control. Many World Championships were won using our Fairway Drivers. These discs can inspire a new level of confidence in your game. Improve the level of your game with the superior control of our Fairway Drivers.
